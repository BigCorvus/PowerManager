# PowerManager
![PowerManagerV2](https://github.com/BigCorvus/PowerManager/blob/master/BatteryManagerV2brd.png)
Small battery and power manager PCB based on a previously designed charger+LDO board. Even breaks out the USB data pins and can therefore be integrated into any battery-powered project. Besides the ever-useful sot-23 Lithium charger (MCP73831) and 3,3V LDO this new version has additional features: MCU-controlled power latching using a pushbutton and a BQ27441-G1A fuel gauge with current sensing capability. Various LDO models can be used depending on current requirements and quiescent current. They should match the footprint and have an active high enable pin. Examples are AP2112 or XC6215...  
The BTN_TO_MCU pin is an output which is high as soon as long as the button is pressed. It can beused to control stuff inside your application code. The PHOLD pin is an input which has to be pulled up by the microcontroller as soon as possible. Actually this should be the first thing your code does. After the button is pushed the EN pin of the LDO is pulled up for a short period, which depends on the capacitor. 10ÂµF give you about 2 seconds to react.
